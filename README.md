# Survey Framework
These are some survey guidelines for UX research project.

## Pillar 1

**Pre exploration and post exploration questionnaire? Or both?**

1.  We have **pre questionnaire** which includes set of core questions focussing on the user and their expectations about the open learning platform, which also includes user’s demographics.
2.  Then we have **post questionnaire** that happens after the user has explored the website. These questions focus on the experience of the user with Open learning platform interface.

## Pillar 2

**Delivery method for** **pre and post questionnaire**

1.  Recruit the participants and send them the link for a survey and open learning platform
